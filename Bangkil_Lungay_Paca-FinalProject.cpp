1.	GPA Converter – This feature converts the student’s average grade percentage into the Grade Weighted Average (GWA) using the 1.0–5.0 scale based on the conversion chart.
2.	Director’s List Check – This feature checks if the student’s GWA qualifies for the Director’s List (GWA ≤ 1.5). If the requirement is met, the program displays a congratulatory message.
3.	Input Validation – This feature ensures that all entered grades are valid by requiring values between 0 and 100. If the input is invalid, the program keeps asking until the user enters a correct grade.
